# Sentiment Analysis and NLP #

This project creates a model which analyses the input text entry, generates an score and classifies as negative or positive. Finally, for paragraphs of text, the model generates an average score and then uses this average score to plot graphs.

## Prerequisites ##

* I have included a Jupyter Notebook file (.ippynb) in the 'nlp' directory, so, you will need to install Jupyter Notebook in order to run it. Follow the link below to get Jupyter Notebook.
