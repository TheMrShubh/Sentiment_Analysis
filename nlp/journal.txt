I had a great day. I feel amazing. I had a lot of fun with my friends.
Today, the day was alright. I don’t like dogs.
Another bad day. Not very productive. I don’t like going out with family. They make me feel bad.
Amazingly fun day. I want a new dog. My girlfriend and I are moving in.
School was tough today. I wish I didn’t have to go to school. The teachers are not very helpful.
Wow. The dog that I got is amazing. He plays with me all day. I love spending time with him.
Tim was very loving and helpful today. I got a lot of work done. It was a nice day
Today was low and gloomy. I had a bad day at work and I wanted to go home
Today was the best day of my life. I met a guy and he was just like me. i think we can be good friends in the future.
Today was a very tiring day at work. The workload was insane and my boss is an ass. However I got all the work done in Time and left for the family dinner.
I am very disappointed with myself. Nothing I want goes as planned, my life is a mess. I want to kill myself and end this once and for all.
My boyfriend is a horrible human. He just uses me at his disposal.
I feel very aimless. My job is a mess and so is my personal life.
Getting a dog home was the best idea ever. He induces positive vibes in me always.
